# Predicting NASDAQ Stock Prices Through Sentiment Analysis of U.S. Presidentâ€™s Social Media Posts
This project investigates the influence of U.S. President Donald Trump's social media posts on the NASDAQ Composite Index by leveraging sentiment analysis and deep learning-based time series prediction models. The code in this repository supports the experiments described in the draft paper, which aims to empirically validate how political sentiment impacts financial markets.

Using sentiment analysis tools like VADER and RoBERTa, the project extracts positive, neutral, and negative sentiment from the President's posts. The extracted sentiment data, along with historical NASDAQ index values, are used as inputs to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models to predict stock market trends.

This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and results visualization, providing a reproducible framework for the experiments presented in the draft paper.
